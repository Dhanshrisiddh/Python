# Simple KBC Game in Python
# Write a python program to translate a message into secret code language. Use the rules below to translate normal English into secret code language
# Coding:
# if the word contains atleast 3 characters, remove the first letter and append it at the end now append three random characters at the starting and the end else: simply reverse the string

# Decoding:
# if the word contains less than 3 characters, reverse it else: remove 3 random characters from start and end. Now remove the last letter and append it to the beginning

# Your program should ask whether you want to code or decode

# Each question is a dictionary with the question, options and correct answer
